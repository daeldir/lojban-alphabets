    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this page is to see what a text in lojban looks like when
      written in the different existing alphabets. Who knows, we may, in the end,
      create a new alphabet borrowing from all these ones, as it has been done to
      create gismu… In fact, this page is here essentially to satisfy our
      curiosity. If you want to add or imporve an alphabet, feel free! The git
      repository is <a href="https://github.com/daeldir/lojban-alphabets">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many alphabets have been proposed for Lojban. Latin alphabet is used for
      convenience of most western european people. Cyrillic has been introduced
      to help russian learning. Hiragana has been proposed, too. Also, a
      tengwar mode has been created, it's authors stating that it is better to
      use that alphabet in lojban, since it <em>is</em> culturally neutral, and
      has some interesting properties from a linguistic point of view. I
      included braille that I think may also be culturally neutral, but there
      are differences in braille from different countries, and braille is not
      really easy to read with the eyes: it may be better suited for blind
      people than for screen reading! As hangul has some traits of the tengwar,
      being invented with linguistic in mind we may decide to give it a try
      too.

      Notes about each transcription methods are found in the source code. When
      I have time, I may get them on an HTML page, and improve the user
      experience of that page (better input method, better view of the
      differents alphabets, description on it's own page…).
